# Time Bandit

## A time management CLI and Web App

This is a project to make an all in one time management web application and cli app.

Users can create tasks to work on, and then log events to that tasks along with event notes.

The cli application runs locally on an sqlite3 database. 

The web application is built off rust axum and react, 
the intention is that users can log in and use manage their time bandits from
anywhere, view statistics on their time and track their habits,
and then also sink the cloud and local databases to have consistency accross workspaces.

This project is very much a work in progress, although the CLI is usable and can be installed via `cargo install time-bandit`
